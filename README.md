## Machine Learning Model Used
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Reason:**
  - Simple and interpretable
  - Suitable for regression problems
  - Strong baseline model for price prediction

---

## Results
- Laptop price increases with higher RAM and CPU performance
- SSD storage significantly increases laptop price
- Touchscreen and Retina display laptops are more expensive
- Gaming laptops generally have higher prices
- Linear Regression provided reasonable prediction accuracy

## Visualization:
- Actual vs Predicted price scatter plot
- Data points align closely with the diagonal line

---

## Conclusion
Laptop prices can be effectively predicted using machine learning techniques.
Data preprocessing and feature engineering play a crucial role.
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow
and strengthens practical skills in data analysis and ML.
